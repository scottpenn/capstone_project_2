With enough incorrect values from the source data, errors can propogate to future pipeline steps. To correct this, I will instead use [The Investors Exchange](https://iextrading.com/), which provides free historical stock data. This data is more accurate and reliable than the Kaggle repo sourced from Yahoo Finance."

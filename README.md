## SpringBoard Capstone 2
#### Stock Market Analysis and Trading Bot

This project was part of my SpringBoard Data Science curriculum. I focused on creating an organized project structure, and a reproducible data pipeline that can be run at any time with up-to-date stock data.

I had two main goals when starting this project. First, I wanted to better understand market terminology and the history of stock market ups and downs. Second, I wanted to create a model that could outperform a simple investment strategy.

### Notebooks

The data pipeline, contained in the "notebooks" folder, goes as follows:

1. Data Acquisition
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Optional)
3. Technical Indicators
4. Deep Learning
5. Backtesting
6. Paper Trading

Each Notebook must be run in order, to ensure that the proper files are created. Each step may be modified and ran again as long as the previous steps have been run.

The notes contained in the notebooks are a work in progress, and will be updated.
